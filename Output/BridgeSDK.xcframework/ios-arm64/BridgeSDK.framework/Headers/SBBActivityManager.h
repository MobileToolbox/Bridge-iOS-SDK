/*!
 Gets all available, started, or scheduled activities for a user. The "daysAhead" parameter allows you to retrieve activities that are scheduled in the future for the indicated number of days past today (to a maximum of four days, at this time). This allows certain kinds of UIs (e.g. "You have N activities tomorrow" or "You have completed N of X activities today", even when the activities are not yet to be performed). A "daysBehind" parameter allows you to retain previously-cached activities that have not yet been completed that expired within the indicated number of days in the past. This allows UIs that say, e.g., "You left N activities uncompleted yesterday." Scheduled activities will be returned in the timezone of the device at the time of the request. Once a task is finished, or expires (the time has passed for it to be started), or becomes invalid due to a schedule change on the server, it will be removed from the list of scheduled activities returned from Bridge, and (except for previously-fetched but unfinished tasks within daysBehind) will also be removed from the list passed to this method's completion handler.
